# DAV Huts

Project to get notifications for DAV huts availability

I am lately into sleeping in the DAV huts, however i mostly spontaneously decide when and where to go based on multiple factors
like weather or simply my mood :)

The huts are usually full, specially on the weekend however but its very likely that some customers cancel. The main idea of this project its to get some push notification like slack, email or sms when my favorite huts get free slots
